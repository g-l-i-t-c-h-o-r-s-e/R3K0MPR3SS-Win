So you wanna see some artifacts eh? You have quite a few options here; unless you want to spend several days reuploading your content to a host like YewTube.

## So what's it do?
The left side let's you select an audio codec of your choice, and the right side a video codec. With these mystical algorithms you can encode a moving image for your viewing pleasure.

But what happens if you repeat this process several, or even hundreds of times?
Here we find out that we can coax out the elusive artifacts that engineers try so hard to hide.

The boxes underneath the codec lists also allow you to use ffmpeg filters, to iterate on top of the compression artifacts being forced from the codecs. The IMG button allows you to do this process to use a video codec to compress a single image, my personal favorite.
